                   FONTLOG for the Deiphobus fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Deiphobus Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Deiphobus fonts and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information

Deiphobus is an all caps geometric display typeface with bold blocky shapes. The initial design was for Latin script and has since been extended to Cyrillic script. It can easily be extended to cover Greek script and others.

This release supports:

- the Unicode blocks
  * Basic Latin,
  * Latin-1 Supplement, and
  * Latin Extended-A;
- parts of the Unicode block Cyrillic sufficient to cover the character sets:
  * ISO 8859-5 and
  * Windows-1251
- as well as the letters (but not all of the special characters) of the
  * KOI8-R and
  * KOI8-U character sets;
- and various punctuation marks and letterlike symbols to cover the
  * Windows-1252 and
  * Windows-1251 character sets;
- as well as modifying and combining characters that are used as components for glyphs.
